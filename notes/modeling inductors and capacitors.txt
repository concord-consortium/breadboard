inductor, capacitor models

 * tests go in 
 * should be named inductor.js and capacitor.js and go into app/javascript/circuit/
 * should be put in namespace sparks.circuit as sparks.circuit.Inductor and sparks.circuit.Capacitor
 * should use sparks.extend to extend sparks.circuit.Component
 * need to declare FILE inductor.js and //= require ./component
 
 * provide getXXX accessors for any properties defined in the inductor/capacitor model. Let's say it's okay to have
   'resistance', 'inductance', and 'capacitance' rather than to provide a common 'defining parameter' property
   

activity construction using inductors & capacitors

  * Need to modify Breadboard.prototype.component to recognize types "inductor" and "capacitor". Let's hardwire this, I
    guess.
  * Can do this TDD.
  

inductor model properties

  inductance (in Henries)
  

capactitor model properties

  capacitance (in Farad)
 
we're not dealing with troubleshooting exercises yet, nor tolerances, nor are we going to mix the qucs simulation results with the models. So I don't think we need to model any parameters except inductance/capacitance and whatever the base Component class includes.

TDD

tests of the inductor, capacitor, models go in tests/jspec/spec/spec.circuit/

test the following:

  can parse an activity description and make inductors, capacitors as required
  
  can make an inductor and get/set inductance
  can make a capacitor and get/set capacitance

  given an activity description that includes capacitors and/or inductors, we correctly call through to flash

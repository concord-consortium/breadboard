    <h2>Breadboard: Circuit with Off-Board Components</h2>

    <div class="description">
        <p>
            This is an example of a circuit with some components that are not shown on the board. In this case a
            battery and a third resistor are connected in series with the two resistors shown. Can you figure out
            both the voltage of the battery and the resistance of the hidden resistor?
        </p>
        <p>
            Two different features are being used in this circuit:
            <ol>
                <li>Wires connected out of the frame&mdash;this can be done to any of 12 external "holes" arranged
                roughly like clock numbers around the board&mdash;and</li>
                <li>Hidden components, which are connected to the circuit but are not rendered. Note that any component
                can be listed as "hidden". For example, we could hide one of the visible resistors, and the circuit would
                still function correctly, but the use would not be able to see or interact with the resistor.</li>
            </ol>

h3. Installing JSpec

Download the zip file from http://visionmedia.github.com/jspec/, unzip it, and follow the instructions
in readme.rdoc.

h3. Running the specs

You should run spec from the "top" directory. For example,

bc. cd sparks-content/tests/jspec
jspec run --browsers firefox

h5. Running it with rhino in terminal

Because of the jspec bug in optimization you can't do "jspec run --rhino ...".

bc. java -jar spec/support/js.jar -opt -1 spec/rhino-terminal.js

h5. Running it in browsers

bc. jspec run --browsers ff

@spec/spec.dom.html@ is the default html that is opened by the browsers.

h5. Running with a server

bc. jspec run --browsers ff --server

@spec/server.rb@ defines the routes.
@spec/spec.server.html@ is the default html processed by the server.

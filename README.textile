Open Actions of the frame #1 of the "actions" laye and make sure the script instantiates the activity. 
e.g. 
 <code>
 import org.concord.sparks.Activity;
 import org.concord.sparks.activities.ResistorColors;
 
 var topDir = '/sparks-content'; //for rails
 //var topDir = '../..'; //for standalone testing
 
 var activity:Activity = new ResistorColors('Resistor Colors', root, topDir);
 </code>

<p>The precision of a resistor is called the <i>tolerance</i>. 
The tolerance of a four-band resistor is indicated by the color of the fourth band.  
The tolerance of a five-band resistor is indicated by the color of the fifth band.  
The tolerance is given as a percentage.  To calculate the tolerance, you must first calculate the
resistance using the <a href="hint1_colorcode.html">color code</a>.</p>

<br/>

<p>This is a 680 ohm resistor.</p>
<p>The last band is red, which indicates that this resistor
has a 2% tolerance.  This means that the resistor will have a value that
is Â± 2% of 680 ohms.</p>
<p>
2% of 680 ohms is 13.6 ohms.
</p><p><b>
To calculate the min: 680 ohms - 13.6 ohms = 666.4 ohms<br/>
To calculate the max:  680 ohms + 13.6 ohms = 693.6 ohms
</b></p>
<p>
The tolerance range is between 666.4 ohms and 693.6 ohms.  If you measure the resistance of this
resistor with a digital multimeter, and the value falls within the calculated range, the resistor is within tolerance.

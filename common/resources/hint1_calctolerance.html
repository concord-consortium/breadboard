<p>The precision of a resistor is called the <i>tolerance</i>. 
The tolerance of a four-band resistor is indicated by the color of the fourth band.  
The tolerance of a five-band resistor is indicated by the color of the fifth band.  
The tolerance is given as a percentage.  To calculate the tolerance, you must first calculate the
resistance using the <a href="hint1_colorcode.html">color code</a>.</p>

<p><b>How to calculate the tolerance of a resistor</b></p>

<br/>

<p><b>Step 1</b></p>
<p>Determine the rated value of the resistor.  The resistor above is a 680 ohm resistor.</p>
<p><b>Step 2</b></p>
<p>Determine the tolerance of the resistor.  The last band is red, which indicates that this resistor
has a 2% tolerance.  This means that the resistor should have a measured value that falls into the
range between +/- 2% of 680 ohms.</p>
<p><b>Step 3</b></p>
<p>Determine the value of 2% of 680 ohms.  To do this, use a calculator and multiply 680 ohms by .02 
to get 13.6 ohms.
Another way to calculate the percentage is to find 1% of the resistance.  One percent of 680 ohms is 6.8.  
To find one percent of a number, simply move the decimal two places to the left as shown below.  <br/><br/>

<br/><br/>
Multiply 6.8 ohms by 2 to get 13.6 ohms. </p>

<p><b>Step 4</b></p>

<p>
Find the range by calculating the maximum and minimum values.<br/>
To calculate the min: <b>680 ohms - 13.6 ohms = 666.4 ohms</b><br/>
To calculate the max:  <b>680 ohms + 13.6 ohms = 693.6 ohms
</b></p>
<p><b>Step 5</b></p>
<p>
The tolerance range is between 666.4 ohms and 693.6 ohms.  If you measure the resistance of this
resistor with a digital multimeter, and the value falls within the calculated range, the resistor is within tolerance.

<p>Measuring voltage in a circuit is like measuring the
pressure in a water pipe. While a pressure gage indicates the pressure
difference between the inside and the outside of the pipe, a <b>voltmeter</b>
indicates a "pressure" <b>difference</b> between it's red probe and
black probe. It's an "electrical pressure" difference that we call
"voltage."</p>

<p>Each resistor in an electrical circuit "uses up"
some the voltage supplied by the battery or other source. To measure this
voltage drop, use a digital multimeter (DMM), as shown, placing the meter
probes on each end of the resistor. See Figure 1.</p>

<p>The DMM knob must be set to a DCV range to measure DC
voltages. Use the mouse cursor to click and turn the knob to the desired range.
In Figure&nbsp;2, the knob is set to "<b>20 DCV</b>." That means the
DMM can display measurements <b>up to 20 volts.</b> So the DMM reading in
Figure 2 is understood to be 5.79&nbsp;volts.</p>

  set to 20-volt range, reading 5.79 volts.<br></font>
    </td> 
  </tr> 
</table> 

<p>If the knob is turned to &quot;2000m,&quot; the DMM can read
values <b>up to 2000 millivolts.</b> At that setting, the DMM will not show any
decimal places. A display of &quot;652,&quot; for example, would be understood
as 652 millivolts. If the display showed &quot;755&quot; with the knob set to
&quot;1000 DCV,&quot; what is the measurement? <i>(Ans. 755 volts!)</i></p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Be careful working with the units. Most
formulas, like Ohm's law, expect measures in volts. But you will often encounter measures in <i>millivolts</i> (that is, 1/1,000 volt). So, you can convert a measure of 652 millivolts to volts:</p>

<p>As you can see, this conversion is actually as simple as
moving the decimal point three places left. With practice it will become easy!</p>

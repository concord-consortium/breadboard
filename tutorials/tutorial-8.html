<p>

<p>Measuring current in a circuit is like measuring the flow-rate
of water in a sprinkler system. To find out how fast the water is flowing you
must insert a flow meter in the line. It's the same with electricity in a circuit.</p>

<p>A battery forces electric charge (just like water in a pipe)
to move around a circuit. To measure how much charge is moving, you insert a
flow meter in the line. A meter that measures <b>electric current</b> is called
an <b>ammeter</b>. It measures in units of amperes, or Coulombs (a unit of
electric charge) per second. One ampere (or "amp", abbreviated
"A") is quite a lot of current, so in small circuits you will usually
measure in milliamps (1 mA = 1/1000 A) or even microamps (1 <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>m</span>A = 1/1,000,000 A).</p>

<p>In this activity, to place the probes of the digital
multimeter (DMM) ammeter in the line, you need to first <b>lift one of the
leads</b> in the circuit, as shown in Figure&nbsp;1. Then you can touch the pair of
DMM probes to the lifted lead and the adjacent lead. See Figure&nbsp;2. The
electric charge can then flow through the DMM to complete the circuit. When the
DMM knob is turned to a current mode (DCA), the display indicates the rate, that is, the current.</p>

<table style="width: 180px; margin-left: 5px; margin-right:10px;border: none; padding: 5px; float: right">

    <td align="center">

		<font size="-1"><b>Figure 3.</b> Knob changed to 2000&mu;A<br></font>
    </td> 
  </tr> 
</table> 

<p>When the knob is set to "20m," the DMM can read
values <b>up to 20 milliamps.</b> So, Figure&nbsp;2 shows a reading of 0.79 mA. At a
more sensitive knob setting, the DMM can show three&mdash;or sometimes even four&mdash;digits. In Figure&nbsp;3 
the DMM knob is moved to the 2000&mu;A
range, and the same current reading is shown more precisely to be 786&mu;A. </p>

<p><b>Note:</b> Be careful working with units. Most formulas,
like Ohm's law, expect measures in volts (V) and amperes (A). But you will
often encounter voltages in millivolts (that is, 1/1,000 volt) and currents in milliamps
(mA) or microamps (&mu;A). So, you can
convert a measure of 786 microamps to amperes:</p>

<p>As you can see, this conversion is actually as simple as
moving the decimal point six places left. With a little practice it will become
easy for you!</p>
